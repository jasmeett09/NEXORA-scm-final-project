# Implementation Plan
### 1. HTML Structure
Purpose: Define the core structure of the website.

Steps:

Create the basic layout (header, footer, main content sections).
Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>).
Create placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., product grids, cart, etc.).
Ensure accessibility (alt text for images, proper headings, etc.).

### 2. CSS Styling
Purpose: Style the HTML structure to match the design.

Steps:

Define base styles (font, colors, spacing, etc.).
Implement responsive design (media queries for mobile, tablet, desktop).
Use custom variables for colors and fonts.
Style individual components (buttons, product cards, navigation bar).
Ensure consistency in design (align with the color palette, typography, etc.).

### 3. JavaScript Interactivity
Purpose: Add functionality and interactivity to the website.

Steps:

Implement cart functionality (add, remove, and update items).
Enable product search and category filters.
Add event listeners for buttons (e.g., add to cart, product details).
Add form validation for contact and newsletter forms.
Implement animations (e.g., hover effects, product image zoom).

### 4. Git Version Control
Purpose: Use Git for version control and collaboration.

Steps:

After HTML Implementation:
Commit and push changes to GitHub with the message: "Initial HTML structure setup."

After CSS Implementation:
Commit and push changes to GitHub with the message: "Styling added (CSS)."
After JavaScript Implementation:
Commit and push changes to GitHub with the message: "Added interactivity (JavaScript)."

Regular Commits:
Commit after completing significant milestones or features.
Push to the GitHub repository regularly to keep the code backed up and updated.
